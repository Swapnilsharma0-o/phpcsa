# PHPCSA: Personal High-Performance Computing Setup Assistant

Welcome to PHPCSA, the Personal High-Performance Computing Setup Assistant. This project is designed to streamline the process of setting up and managing High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, addressing common challenges such as complex configurations, high costs, and limited support. By offering a user-friendly graphical interface and automated backend tools, PHPCSA aims to make HPC cluster management more accessible and efficient for users with standard hardware.

## Project Overview

Setting up HPC clusters can be a daunting task, involving intricate technical expertise and cumbersome manual processes. Additionally, the high costs associated with HPC vendors and cloud services can be prohibitive. PHPCSA addresses these issues with the following key features:

- **Intuitive GUI**: A graphical user interface that simplifies cluster management and configuration.
- **Automated Backend Tools**: Integration of PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) for network booting and process management features to enhance usability and efficiency.
- **Cost-Effective Deployment**: Provides a practical method for deploying HPC clusters without the need for specialized hardware or expensive software solutions.

## Features

- **Network Booting with PXE**: Streamlines the installation process through network booting, reducing manual setup efforts.
- **Automated Configuration**: Utilizes Ansible playbooks for efficient configuration management of Slurm, LDAP, and Nagios.
- **Stateless Provisioning**: Implements PXE and scripting for stateless provisioning to simplify the deployment process.
- **Networking and DHCP**: Configures networking and DHCP settings to ensure seamless cluster communication.

## Team Contributions

PHPCSA is a collaborative effort, with each team member contributing significantly to the project's success. Here’s how each contributor worked on the project:

1. **[Ankur](https://github.com/ankur0002)**: Worked with integration and Flutter coding, as well as project planning. Managed to resolve integration issues and ensure a seamless interface development process.
2. **[Swapnil Sharma](https://github.com/Swapnilsharma0-o)**: Worked with the development of Ansible playbooks for managing Slurm. Tackled configuration complexities and optimized cluster job scheduling.
3. **[Shree](https://github.com/Shree028)**: Worked with the implementation of Ansible configurations for LDAP and Nagios. Addressed authentication challenges and improved monitoring capabilities.
4. **[ANUJ](https://github.com/zAzNzUzJ)**: Worked with PXE and stateless provisioning scripting. Overcame booting challenges and automated the provisioning process effectively.
5. **[Hariharan](https://github.com/Hariharan-101)**: Worked with networking and DHCP configurations. Resolved network connectivity issues and optimized DHCP settings for better cluster communication.

## Reflections

Working on PHPCSA has been a rewarding experience for all involved. As we reflect on our journey, here are some of our thoughts:

- *“The challenge of integrating various components was tough, but seeing everything come together made it all worthwhile.”* – [Ankur](https://github.com/ankur0002)
- *“Configuring Ansible playbooks for Slurm tested our patience, but it was incredibly satisfying to see job scheduling run smoothly.”* – [Swapnil Sharma](https://github.com/Swapnilsharma0-o)
- *“Setting up LDAP and Nagios was a learning curve, but it taught us a lot about security and monitoring.”* – [Shree](https://github.com/Shree028)
- *“The process of automating PXE provisioning was complex, yet it felt amazing to simplify it for future deployments.”* – [ANUJ](https://github.com/zAzNzUzJ)
- *“Networking issues were a significant hurdle, but resolving them ensured our cluster communicated seamlessly.”* – [Hariharan](https://github.com/Hariharan-101)

We thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and are proud of what we've accomplished. We’re excited about the future and plan to continue enhancing PHPCSA, addressing any issues, and adding new features. A big thank you to all the team members who dedicated their time and expertise to make PHPCSA a reality. Your hard work and commitment have made this project a success.

Thank you for your interest in PHPCSA. We hope this project helps make HPC cluster management simpler and more efficient for everyone!
